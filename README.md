# Welcome!
This is the code for my personal website, i'm developing for a challege and as a resume!
Between work and school I don't have much time to develop, but eventually I want to host projects here.
The most traction has been in the auth branch, I'm working on adding user accounts so that people
signed up can comment on my projects and give feed back.

Currently It is not hosted anywhere but this fall I will be setting it back up in the cloud again.
I host In google cloud in a self managed cloud Infrastructure! Last winter through spring I was running 3 virtual servers.
One for the user database and then two others hosting websites.

I plan to pick back up work in August
